# Storylines

Storylines are the major quest arcs that shape Elise's time in Aetheria. Each represents a distinct path through the game world, with its own cast of characters, locations, and progression. Players are not locked into a single storyline -- choices and stats will naturally draw them toward one or more paths, and some storylines interweave.

All storylines are **in development**. The outlines below capture the intended direction and flavour.

## Model Student

The path of academic excellence. Elise throws herself into her studies, mastering both aetherics and mechanics, aiming to win the prestigious Imperial Cup -- a scholarship competition that draws the brightest minds from across the continent. This route rewards discipline, attendance, and intellectual curiosity, but the pressure mounts as rivals emerge and the workload threatens to consume everything else in her life.

## Queen Bee

University is as much a social arena as an academic one. Elise climbs the hierarchy of student societies, orchestrating alliances, managing rivalries, and positioning herself at the centre of campus life. Influence is the currency here -- knowing the right people, attending the right events, and pulling the right strings. But social power is fragile, and there is always someone scheming to take the throne.

## Socialite

Aetheria's upper echelons glitter with brass and ambition. Through connections, charm, and careful self-presentation, Elise gains entry to the salons and soirees of the city's elite. Fine clothes, refined manners, and the right invitations open doors to wealth and privilege -- but high society has its own rules, and those who stumble are quickly forgotten.

## Entertainer

The theatres and dance halls of Aetheria offer a world of glamour and applause. Elise pursues a life on stage -- whether as a dancer, actress, or performer -- honing her craft and building a reputation. The entertainment world is intoxicating but precarious, full of rivalries, demanding directors, and audiences that can turn on a whim.

## Vice

Beneath the brass veneer, Lowtown runs on its own economy. Elise is drawn into the underworld of backstreet gangs, smuggling rings, and illicit trade. The money is good and the freedom intoxicating, but the deeper she goes the harder it becomes to walk away. Trust is scarce, betrayal is common, and the city watch is never far behind.

## Adventurer

Some problems cannot be solved in a lecture hall. Strange occurrences in the city's depths, rumours of ancient mechanisms beneath the streets, and threats that the authorities refuse to acknowledge -- Elise finds herself drawn into genuine danger. This path rewards courage, resourcefulness, and a willingness to venture where sensible people would not.

## Mechanic

Aetheria's skyline is dominated by airships, and the fleet yards are always short of skilled hands. Elise apprentices with the engineers and pilots who keep the city connected to the world, learning to build, repair, and eventually design flying machines of her own. Grease-stained and wind-burned, she earns respect through competence in a world that values results over credentials.

## Aethermancer

Aetherics is taught as a respectable academic discipline, but its deeper applications blur the line between science and something stranger. Elise pushes beyond the curriculum, experimenting with raw aetheric manipulation -- part hacker, part sorcerer. The university disapproves, the authorities are wary, and the power itself has a way of demanding more than the wielder intends to give.

# Ultimate Endings

Each storyline will also have a secret, hard to obtain "Ultimate" Ending. This is intended as a challenge for experienced players, and will probably require NG+ perks or extreme skill / luck to achieve. Not available in Easy mode!

# NPC Romance Paths

There will be romance options with various (most?) NPCs depending on the paths the player chooses. Elise may get a different ending if she chooses romance over following one of the main quest lines (both are possible, but may be hard or impossible to achieve certain main ending / NPC romance combinations). Fun challenge...

## Dream Girl (Rob Hayes)

The easy early romance that becomes progressively harder to maintain. Rob is warm and eager from day one, but after intimacy his devotion curdles into neediness. Reaching affection 90+ requires high Charm and Perception, regular intimacy, and consistently prioritising Rob over other storylines. The title is his fantasy, not the player's. See `src/story/npc/Rob.ts` for full mechanical details.
